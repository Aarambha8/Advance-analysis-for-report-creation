# Advance-analysis-for-report-creation
**📌 Project Overview**

This project extends foundational EDA into advanced analytical patterns using SQL, focusing on how business performance evolves over time, how value accumulates, and how customers and products contribute differently to overall results.

The analysis is built on a Gold-layer data warehouse and is designed to answer strategic business questions, not just descriptive ones.
